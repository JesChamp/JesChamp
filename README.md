### Welcome to my Coding Journey! 

```
Hello World!
```

My name is Jesse Champion. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting, but have always been interested in programming. 

My goal is to self teach myself to become a full stack developer by learning
[] JavaScript, SQL, Python, C++ and Haskell.

This is my serious attempt to keep myself accountable for learning everyday as a first time programmer. I am always open to constructive criticism and continual learning.
