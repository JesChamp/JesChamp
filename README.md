This is my serious attempt to keep myself accountable for learning everyday. In addition to tracking my daily GitHub commits, I will also stream myself on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jessenextdoor) occasionally. Feel free to join the stream while I learn! 

As a first time programmer, I am always open to constructive criticism and continual learning, so please do give me your inputs!

Throughout my jouney, I will need to survive! This means using my degree and working in some area of accounting in addition to learning how code on the side. This comes with enormous benefits, first being that I will be able to pay off my student loans, save up for a car, start investing and offically start my life by moving out. Most importantly, I will gain firsthand experience with enterprise level software and invaluable business experience, which are necessities for the successful completion of my personal development roadmap. 

The timeframe to become a advanced beginner in the majority (51%) of the languages/concepts/applications, competent in two languages and develop my first application on the Cardano Blockchain in four years or by Q4 2026.  

The timeframe will be reviewed quarterly, beginning January 1st, 2023, to ensure that the timeframe is still achievable. Adjustments can be made due to any unforeseen conditions.
