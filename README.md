### Welcome to my Coding Journey! 

```js
<script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>
 ```
My name is Jesse Champion. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting, but have always been interested in programming. 

My goal is to self teach myself to become a full stack developer. 

These are the languages I would like to learn:
| Languages | Status |
|:---| :---:|
| JavaScript | Learning | 
| SQL | Learning |
| Python | Pending |
| C++ | Pending |
| Haskell | Learning | 

This is my serious attempt to keep myself accountable for learning everyday. In addition to tracking my daily GitHub commits, I will also stream myself on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jessenextdoor). Feel free to join the stream while I learn! 

As a first time programmer, I am always open to constructive criticism and continual learning, so please do give me your inputs!
